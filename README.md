# slide_rotate
A simple demonstration of using pycaret to solve a tricky problem using physics-rule based approach. 

Slide/rotate classification is one of the most fundamental step needs to be done in doing drilling analytics.
Yet, the traditional approach of using phsyics-rule based classification always leads to sub-optimal results.
This simple sample with a limited dataset shows some pretty good results from some common classificaton algorithms.
